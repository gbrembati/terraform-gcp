# Terraform Projects
This repository is a collection of Terraform automation projects applicable to GCP, which are intended to be used as a template in a demonstration or to build a test environment.  In the directories, you will find a description of what the each project does and if you want (or need) to customize them, you can change defaults in the different __*name-variables.tf*__ files.
